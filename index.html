			My name is Solomon Bell and I am a second year student at UCSC. My proposed major is AGPM as of this quarter.
			I currently am living in the Central Valley, where it is much too warm for the middle of January.
			Outside of school, I like working out, playing volleyball and video games, and watching anime.
			I'm currently working at a grocery chain called Raley's, where half the people I work with take their masks off the instant they clock out, not even waiting to leave the building.
			Some random fun facts about me is that I love the colors blue, purple and pink, my favorite food is orange chicken or ramen, and I used to do theater throughout middle and high school.
