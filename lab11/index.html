				<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>
						After the debacle that was last lab and today's discussion, I feel as though I have a much better understanding of what to do. For one, jQuery is much easier to understand.
						It is way easier to format and easier to assign variables, for me at least. I didn't have much problems other than syntax errors, but I feel like I'm getting better about that.

						Click the buttons, baby! You can do it.
