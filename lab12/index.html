				<h2>Challenges</h2>
					<p>
						We were assigned to create a function that depended on conditionals. In this case, that was the inputted name.
						We were to take the name and use it to sort people into what Harry Potter house they belong in.
					</p>

				<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>
						This assignment wasn't too bad. We've begun getting more and more used to javascript and how it works, and creating functions is something I knew how to do pretty well.
						The majority of the work we had was determining how to apply the knowledge we had.

				<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>
						Enter your name and find out which house you should belong to!
