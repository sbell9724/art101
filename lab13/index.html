				<h2>Challenges</h2>
					<p>
						Working with our partners, we were to experiment with loops. To do this, we were supposed to create a function that iterates through the numbers 1-200 and adds either fizz, buzz, boom, or a combination of the three if they meet one of three credentials.

				<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>
						The assignment was really chill. Once I learned how to use for loops in Javascript as opposed to Python, it was a simple transition and use of for loops. In fact, I believe I've done a very similar bit of code in Python for another class, so this was like reaching into by brain library.
