			<h1>Hello World</h1>

			<p id="brennan">
				My name is Brennan Elliott and I am a first year student at ucsc.
				I am currently an art major and plan to double major in art and psychology.
				I grew up in Culver City, California and am currently living here wishing I
				could be in Santa Cruz. I work at a restaurant called Caliornia Chicken Cafe
				where I prepare food nd come into contact with way too many people during the pandemic.
				I have been staying sane during the pandemic by going to the gym, playing guitar,
				and messing with my 3D printer.

			<p id="solomon">
				My name is Solomon Bell and I am a second year student at UCSC. My proposed major is AGPM as of this quarter.
				I currently am living in the Central Valley, where it is much too warm for the middle of January.
				Outside of school, I like working out, playing volleyball and video games, and watching anime.
				I'm currently working at a grocery chain called Raley's, where half the people I work with take their masks off the instant they clock out, not even waiting to leave the building.
				Some random fun facts about me is that I love the colors blue, purple and pink, my favorite food is orange chicken or ramen, and I used to do theater throughout middle and high school.
