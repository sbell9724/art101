	<h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
		<p>
			Our job was to both structure and transfer our files.
		</p>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>
				Overall this project was made much easier due to the fact that most of the organization was already done for us by Wes when we set up our Github accounts.
				The most difficult part about this project was working with the time constraints we had.
				This is our first time having to do two labs in one week so on the second one we were a little crunched for time.
				We also had to work around our different scheduling issues since we both had work and other commitments.
				However, the majority of the coding for the lab was very simple.
				Towards the end we ran into a problem where the image on our home page was the correct size when loaded locally but, it was much larger once uploaded to github.
				After some trial and error we were able to fix the problem.

				You're looking at em, beautiful.
