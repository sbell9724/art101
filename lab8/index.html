  	<h1>Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>

  		<h2>Challenge</h2>
  			<p>
          Our challenge was defining functions outside of their call, and then anonymously calling on them later in the code.
  			</p>

      <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>
          Honestly, the code was somewhat easy. This felt more similar to python, other than some of the syntax required for setTimeout.
          The biggest problem I was running across was the my HTML code was losing all color when I was closing my script for javascript.
          However, this caused me to learn about auto-detect in Atom, which is extremely helpful for formatting files if you forget to when creating them.
        </p>

  		<h2>Results</h2>
  			<p>
            You'll see in the console, with a little bit of my own flair! (Hint, I was extremely hungry writing this code.)
